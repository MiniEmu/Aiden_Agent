# üß† Aiden API Agent

Aiden is a dual-LLM agent framework with GUI control and validation logic. It allows two large language models ("Left" and "Right") to interact intelligently, validate each other's commands, and execute them in a sandboxed environment. Inspired by cognitive architectures and inner-monologue agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> **Note:** Currently Windows-only due to screen size detection via `ctypes.windll.user32`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `requests`, `tkinter` (comes with most Python installs), `sqlite3`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aiden-agent.git
   cd aiden-agent

   Set up the directory structure in C:\AIAgent and place:

agent_init.txt and agent2.txt in memory\

Email credentials in memory\EmailCred.txt

hemisphere.json and hemisphere_api.json in root

Install dependencies (if needed):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
Run the agent:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Aiden_API.py
‚öôÔ∏è Config Files

    "provider": "huggingface",

    "api_token": "hf_your_token_here"
  },
  "right": {
    "provider": "openrouter",
    "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",

    "api_token": "your_openrouter_key"

    "host": "smtp.gmail.com",

  }
}
üí° How It Works
You click "Resume" in the GUI.

The right LLM generates a command in this format:

less
Copy
Edit
{{#command#}arg1|arg2|arg3[END_CMD]
The left LLM verifies and agrees (or disagrees).

If both agree, the command is run.

The result is shown in the GUI and sent back to the right LLM.

üìú Supported Commands
filewrite ‚Äì Write content to a file in scripts or memory

creatememoryentry ‚Äì Insert memory into the SQLite DB

getfilecontent ‚Äì Read memory files

searchmemory ‚Äì Keyword search memory or database

sendemail ‚Äì Send emails via SMTP

runcommand ‚Äì Run a shell script

browseweb ‚Äì Stubbed; not supported in API mode

üß± To-Do & Future Ideas
 Add cross-platform screen detection

 Queue-based thread-safe communication

 Command sandboxing and validation layer

 Optional CLI mode without GUI

 Web-based control panel
